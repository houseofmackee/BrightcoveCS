# Brightcove API example for Dynamic Ingest

This project shows how the Brightcove APIs can be used with C# to ingest local videos to Video Cloud.

Please note that this will work from desktop environments (tested), but will probably not work if used in ASP.NET pages due to CORS. If you run into this problem I believe the only way to solve this is to use the PHP proxy provided by Brightcove in all their CMS API example pages.
