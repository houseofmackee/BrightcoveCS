# New Brightcove APIs Examples using CSharp

This project shows how the new Brightcove APIs can be used with C#

Please note that this will work from desktop environments (tested), but will probably not work if used in ASP.NET pages due to CORS. If you run into this problem I believe the only way to solve this is to use the PHP proxy provided by Brightcove in all their CMS API example pages.

All code is provided as-is and purely as example. Use it at your own risk. No support is provided for it in any way, form or shape.
